    <p>The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.[2] The
        framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web
        applications on top of the Jakarta EE platform. The framework does not impose any specific programming model.[3]
        The framework has become popular in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)
        model.[4] The Spring Framework is free and open source software.[5</p>
