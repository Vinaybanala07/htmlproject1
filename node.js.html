    <p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix,
        macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
        According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, Node.js is one of the most commonly used web technologies.[6]

        Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and server-side scripting. The ability to run
        JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the
        user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[7] unifying
        web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for
        the server- versus client-side programming.

        Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize
        throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web
        applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).[8]

        The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation,[9] and has now
        merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated by the Linux
        Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[</p>
