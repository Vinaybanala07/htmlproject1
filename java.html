    <p>Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let
        programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
        support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can
        run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is
        similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic
        capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional
        compiled languages.

        Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then.[19]
        Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub.[20] Although still widely
        popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining
        popularity.[21]

        Java was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun's
        Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries
        were released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the
        Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle,
        which bought Sun in 2010, offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine. However, the official reference
        implementation is the OpenJDK JVM, which is open-source software used by most developers and is the default JVM
        for almost all Linux distributions.

        Java 25 is the version current as of September 2025. Java 8, 11, 17, 21, and 25 are long-term support versions
        still under maintenance</p>
